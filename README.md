## Background
  Vibe is a music game based on Tap Tap/Guitar Hero that also displays audio visualization. An audio file will produce a set of keys that the player should match. Each time a player correctly matches the key, he earns points. 

## Functionality & MVP
  - Users will be able to:
    - Start, pause and restart the game.
    - Select from a list of songs to play.
    - Earn points from matched keys.
  - In addition, the project will include:
    - A modal describing rules and controls for the game.
    - A production README.
